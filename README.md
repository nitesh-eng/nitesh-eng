- 👋 Hi, I’m Nitesh Mainaly (@nitesh-eng), iOS Developer at Fusion of Ideas (Irvine, CA).
- 👀 I’m interested in all things iOS. I also find machine learning and blockchain technology to be facinating.
- 🌱 I’m currently filling in the gaps in my iOS dev knowledge by learning different frameworks and design patterns. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any iOS applications that take advantage of Vision or ARKit.
